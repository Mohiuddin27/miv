         <h1 class="fw-bolder  pt-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

         <div class="question mt-5 pb-5">
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">How can I ensure my examples demonstrate a high bar?</h5>
            <p>Examples should be discussed in the STAR format. Additionally, examples should show that the nominee
               was/is a major contributor to building equity for the LGBTQIA+ community. Use data that quantifies the
               impact of the project, initiative, program, etc. For example: Surveying the growth and development of her
               city and recognizing a gap in after-school activities for students in underserved communities, Janet led
               the efforts between Amazon and AfterSchool2Day to build a mentorship program for LGBTQIA+ high school
               students living below the poverty line. As a result of this partnership, AfterSchool2Day launched the
               AfterSchool Academy supported by Janet’s Amazon team and her Glamazon chapter. The Academy's purpose is
               to empower LGBTQIA+ students in underfunded communities to engage in engaging, safe, and fun after school
               activities. Since Janet helped program manage AfterSchool2Day's initiatives in San Francisco, over 850
               students have been able to attend the Academy. AfterSchool2Day and Amazon continue to have a strong
               relationship and are looking to build more programs for underfunded communities in the near future.</p>
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">Can I nominate myself?</h5>
            <p>Yes. You may nominate someone else or yourself, as long as you tell your story and share your impact!</p>
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">Can I nominate anonymously?

            </h5>
            <p>No. Nominations cannot be done anonymously. Our judging panel may have follow up questions or
               clarifications and we need to be able to find you!

            </p>


            <h5 class="fw-bolder">Will multiple nominations improve my chances at selection?</h5>
            <p>No. Multiple nominations will not improve your chances. Duplicate nominations will be considered as a
               single entry.</p>
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">Can I nominate someone who doesn’t work at Amazon or has worked at Amazon in the past,
               but is no longer an employee?</h5>
            <p>No. Although many of us are fortunate to know trailblazers all around, the Making the Invisible, Visible
               campaign is for current, full-time Amazonians.</p>
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">Will winners need to provide additional information?</h5>
            <p>Yes. If you are one of the winners, you will need to provide a headshot. The WW Amazon Stores DEI team
               will provide more information at this stage.
